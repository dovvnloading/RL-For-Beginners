## Overview

Welcome to **RL from Zero: Building Intelligent Agents Step by Step**, a comprehensive, beginner-friendly text-based course on Reinforcement Learning (RL). This repository hosts all course materials, including detailed explanations, conceptual diagrams, quizzes, and project ideas presented in Markdown format. Designed for absolute beginners, the course assumes only basic Python knowledge and guides you through the fundamentals of RL, from core concepts to practical applications.

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or professional transitioning into AI, this self-paced course equips you with the foundational understanding to explore intelligent agents. By the end, you'll grasp how RL powers applications in robotics, gaming, finance, and autonomous systems. All content is accessible directly in your browserâ€”no cloning or setup required. Code examples, when referenced, can be sourced and run from external platforms or your local environment.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:
- Basic proficiency in Python (e.g., variables, loops, functions).
- No prior experience in Machine Learning or RL is required.

For any hands-on experimentation mentioned, you may need:
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries like NumPy, Gymnasium, and Matplotlib (install via pip in your own environment if desired).

## Course Structure

The course is divided into modular sections, each building on the previous one. Each module includes:
- Explanatory text with analogies and diagrams.
- Conceptual exercises and quizzes.
- References to further reading and external resources for code examples.

### Modules
1. **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**  
   Core concepts: Agents, environments, states, actions, rewards. Simple conceptual simulations to get started.

2. **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**  
   Mathematical foundations, Bellman equations, and solving basic MDPs.

3. **Model-Free Methods: Q-Learning**  
   Exploration strategies, Q-tables, and conceptual training in discrete environments like Frozen Lake.

4. **Value-Based Methods: SARSA and Extensions**  
   On-policy vs. off-policy learning, handling continuous spaces.

5. **Policy Gradient Methods and Actor-Critic**  
   Gradient-based optimization, REINFORCE, and A2C algorithms. Conceptual projects like CartPole balancing.

6. **Advanced Deep RL: DQN and PPO**  
   Neural networks in RL, experience replay, and stable policy optimization for complex tasks.

7. **Real-World Applications and Ethical Considerations**  
   RL in practice: Robotics, games, and beyond. Discussions on reward design, safety, and biases.

8. **Capstone Project**  
   Ideas for building your own RL agent for a custom problem. Extensions to multi-agent systems.

Progress through the modules sequentially for the best learning experience. Modules are available as Markdown files in the `modules/` directory.

## Getting Started

Browse the repository on GitHub to access the course materials. Start with the first module and work your way through. For any code snippets discussed, copy them into your preferred coding environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, online IDE) to experiment independently.
