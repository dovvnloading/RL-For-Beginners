# RL from Zero: Course Curriculum

Welcome to your learning journey! This curriculum is designed to take you from the absolute basics of Reinforcement Learning to understanding the foundational concepts behind modern, cutting-edge AI agents.

Our philosophy is **intuition first, math second**. We'll start with simple analogies and build up to formal concepts, ensuring you have a solid foundation at every step. The course is structured into sequential modules, each building upon the knowledge of the last.

Let's see what you'll learn.

---

### **Module 1: Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (The "What & Why")**

Our goal in this first module is to build a strong, intuitive understanding of what Reinforcement Learning is, without overwhelming you with complex math. We'll answer the fundamental "what" and "why" questions.

*   **Lesson 1.1: What is Reinforcement Learning?**
    *   Discover the core idea of learning through trial and error, just like training a pet or learning a new skill. We'll see how RL differs from other types of Machine Learning.
*   **Lesson 1.2: The Core Components: Agents and Environments**
    *   Meet the two main characters in every RL story: the **Agent** (the learner) and the **Environment** (the world it lives in).
*   **Lesson 1.3: The Language of Learning: Rewards and Policies**
    *   Learn the language of RL. We'll explore **Rewards** (the goals), the importance of long-term gain, and the **Policy** (the agent's brain or strategy).

### **Module 2: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) (The "Rules of the Game")**

Now that we have the intuition, it's time to learn the 'rules of the game.' This module introduces the elegant mathematical framework that underpins all of modern RL, giving our concepts a solid structure.

*   **Lesson 2.1: The Markov Property: "The Future is Independent of the Past"**
    *   Understand the simple but powerful assumption that allows us to model complex problems: that the future only depends on the present.
*   **Lesson 2.2: Formalizing the MDP: The 5-Tuple**
    *   We'll assemble the complete blueprint for an RL problem using states, actions, transition probabilities, rewards, and the crucial **Discount Factor (gamma)**.
*   **Lesson 2.3: The Bellman Equations: Tying It All Together**
    *   Meet the most famous equations in RL. We'll break down the Bellman equations to see how they elegantly connect the value of a state to the values of future states.

### **Module 3: Model-Free Methods: Q-Learning (Learning by Doing)**

What happens when we don't know the rules of the game in advance? In this module, you'll learn your first practical, learning-based algorithm, Q-Learning, which allows an agent to learn optimal behavior from raw experience.

*   **Lesson 3.1: Model-Based vs. Model-Free Learning**
    *   Learn the critical difference between having a map (model-based) and learning by exploring a new city (model-free).
*   **Lesson 3.2: The Q-Table: The Agent's "Cheat Sheet"**
    *   Discover how we can use a simple table to store the agent's knowledge about the value of its actions.
*   **Lesson 3.3: The Q-Learning Algorithm: The Update Rule**
    *   Dive into the simple but powerful update rule at the heart of Q-Learning, based on the principle of "Temporal Difference."
*   **Lesson 3.4: Exploration vs. Exploitation**
    *   Tackle a fundamental dilemma in RL: should you stick with what you know works, or try something new? We'll explore the simple and effective Epsilon-Greedy strategy.

### **Module 4: Value-Based Methods: SARSA and Extensions**

Building on Q-Learning, we'll explore a related algorithm and begin to think about the limitations of our table-based methods.

*   **Lesson 4.1: On-Policy vs. Off-Policy Learning**
    *   Understand the subtle but important difference between learning from your current actions (On-Policy) and learning from hypothetical ones (Off-Policy).
*   **Lesson 4.2: The SARSA Algorithm**
    *   Meet SARSA, the on-policy cousin of Q-Learning, and understand how its slightly different approach can lead to safer, more conservative agents.
*   **Lesson 4.3: The Problem with Big Tables: The Need for Approximation**
    *   Confront the reality that Q-tables are impractical for large problems (like chess) and set the stage for using neural networks.

---

### **Module 5: Policy Gradient Methods and Actor-Critic**

In this module, we explore a completely different approach. Instead of learning the *value* of actions, what if we could learn the *policy* directly?

*   **Lesson 5.1: A New Approach: Learning the Policy Directly**
    *   Shift your perspective from value-based methods to policy-based methods.
*   **Lesson 5.2: The REINFORCE Algorithm: "Policy Gradients 101"**
    *   Learn the foundational policy gradient algorithm that directly adjusts the agent's strategy based on whether outcomes were good or bad.
*   **Lesson 5.3: Actor-Critic: The Best of Both Worlds**
    *   Combine the strengths of value-based and policy-based methods into one powerful framework: the Actor-Critic model.

### **Module 6: Advanced Deep RL: DQN and PPO**

Let's bridge the gap to modern RL. Here, we'll replace our simple tables with powerful neural networks, allowing us to solve much more complex problems.

*   **Lesson 6.1: Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Q-Learning with Neural Networks**
    *   See how a neural network can be used to approximate a Q-table, enabling us to handle environments with massive numbers of states.
*   **Lesson 6.2: Key Innovations: Experience Replay and Target Networks**
    *   Discover the two clever tricks that made the original DQN stable and successful.
*   **Lesson 6.3: Introduction to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
    *   Get a high-level overview of PPO, a modern, reliable, and widely-used Actor-Critic algorithm that powers many state-of-the-art results.

### **Module 7: Real-World Applications and Ethical Considerations**

With a strong theoretical foundation, we'll step back and look at the bigger picture: where RL is used today and the important challenges that come with it.

*   **Lesson 7.1: RL in the Wild: Gaming, Robotics, and Finance**
    *   Explore real-world case studies of Reinforcement Learning in action.
*   **Lesson 7.2: The Challenge of Reward Design and "Reward Hacking"**
    *   Learn why crafting the right reward function is one of the hardest parts of RL and see humorous examples of agents finding loopholes in their goals.
*   **Lesson 7.3: Safety, Bias, and the Ethical Implications of RL**
    *   Discuss the important considerations of building safe, reliable, and fair autonomous agents.

### **Module 8: Capstone Project**

It's time to put your knowledge to the test! This final module is a guide to help you start your own RL project.

*   **Lesson 8.1: Brainstorming Your Project: Choosing an Environment**
    *   Get guidance on how to find and select a suitable problem for your first RL project.
*   **Lesson 8.2: Project Ideas: From Simple Grid Worlds to Custom Games**
    *   Explore a list of project ideas to spark your imagination.
*   **Lesson 8.3: Next Steps: Where to Go from Here**
    *   A look at the vast world beyond this course, with pointers to advanced topics like Multi-Agent RL, Model-Based RL, and more.
